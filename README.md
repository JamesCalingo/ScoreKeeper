# ScoreKeeper
Keep scores for board games!
(And yes, I know I did this already. I'm doing it again for certain reasons.)

# How it works
Originally, I was going to have just one page for six players (as I did in the previous version of this), but I ended up deciding to do a scaling thing. With that in mind...

On the first page (index.html), you'll be asked how many players you're going to be keeping score for. Once you select a number (up to 8), You'll then be taken to the page for the number of players you chose.

After that, it's somewhat self-explanatory: You have buttons to add or subtract points from different players, and pushing them adds or subtracts points from their individual total.
