# ScoreKeeper
Keep scores for board games!
(And yes, I know I did this already. I'm doing it again for certain reasons.)

# How it works
Originally, I was going to have just one page for six players (as I did in the previous version of this), but I ended up deciding to do a scaling thing. With that in mind...

On the first page (index.html), you'll be asked how many players you're going to be keeping score for. Once you select a number (up to 8), You'll then be taken to the page for the number of players you chose.

After that, it's somewhat self-explanatory: You have buttons to add or subtract points from different players, and pushing them adds or subtracts points from their individual total.

Be aware that this app does have the ability to go into the negatives; I wasn't sure whether or not to allow this, but I figure that having that option can't hurt.

# The future
Right now, the app works fine as is. However...I'm always looking for ways to improve things.

In that regard, I'm working on a way to have player names be changed to give some level of customization. This should be available in the very near future.

I also hope to have color changing soon. I tried to pick colors that would be different from each other for the individual players, but some games/players may choose other colors than the ones I have; for example, the first two players are red and blue, but if the players chose black and green, I'd have an option to switch to those colors.

I may also see if I can figure out a way to make using the app as a life counter easier as well (and before you ask, yes, there are games that have a life counter and more than two players; for example, the Realms series of deckbuilders).

Also, if you look at the files, things are...a bit messy. One of my priorities is optimizing the JavaScript end of the app, so you won't see any changes, but it will be much nicer on that end.
